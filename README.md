In this assignment, I created a Python-based Mashup Generator.

The program downloads songs of a given singer from YouTube, converts them into audio files, trims the first few seconds of each audio, and then merges them into a single mashup file.



In my program, I implemented:

- Downloading N videos using yt-dlp
- Converting videos into audio format
- Trimming the first Y seconds of each audio file
- Merging all trimmed audio files into one MP3 file
- Command line argument handling
- Input validation checks
- Exception handling for errors



## Libraries Used

- yt-dlp  
- pydub  
- ffmpeg  
- Python

## Results

After running the program successfully:

- The required number of videos were downloaded.
- Audio files were extracted and trimmed to the specified duration.
- All trimmed audio files were merged into one final MP3 file.
- The final mashup file was generated successfully without errors.
